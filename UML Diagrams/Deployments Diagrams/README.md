## When to Use Deployment Diagram
- What existing systems will the newly added system need to interact or integrate with.
- How robust does system need to be (e.g., redundant hardware in case of a system failure).
- What and who will connect to or interact with system, and how will they do it.
- What middleware, including the operating system and communications approaches and protocols, will system use.
- What hardware and software will users directly interact with (PCs, network computers, browsers, etc).
- How will you monitor the system once deployed.
- How secure does the system needs to be (e.g. needs a firewall, physically secure hardware, etc).
