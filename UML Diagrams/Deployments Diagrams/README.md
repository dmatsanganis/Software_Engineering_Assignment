## Deployment Diagram
**_A Deployment Diagram_** shows the configuration of run time processing nodes and the components that live on them.
**_A Deployment Diagrams_** is a kind of structure diagram used in modeling the physical aspects of an Object Oriented System. 
They are often be used to model the static deployment view of a system, _topology of the hardware_.

## When to Use Deployment Diagram
- What existing systems will the newly added system need to interact or integrate with.
- How robust does system need to be (e.g., redundant hardware in case of a system failure).
- What and who will connect to or interact with system, and how will they do it.
- What middleware, including the operating system and communications approaches and protocols, will system use.
- What hardware and software will users directly interact with (PCs, network computers, browsers, etc).
- How will you monitor the system once deployed.
- How secure does the system needs to be (e.g. needs a firewall, physically secure hardware, etc).

## Purpose of Deployment Diagrams
- They show the structure of the run-time system
- They capture the hardware that will be used to implement the system and the links between different items of hardware.
- They model physical hardware elements and the communication paths between them
- They can be used to plan the architecture of a system.
- They are also useful for Document the deployment of software components or nodes
