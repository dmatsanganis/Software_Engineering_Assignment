# UML Diagrams
A UML diagram is a diagram based on the UML (Unified Modeling Language) with the purpose of visually representing a system along with its main actors, roles, actions, artifacts or classes, in order to better understand, alter, maintain, or document information about the system.

## What is UML?
UML is an acronym that stands for **Unified Modeling Language**. Simply put, UML is a modern approach to modeling and documenting software. 
In fact, it’s one of the most popular _business process modeling techniques_.

It is based on **diagrammatic representations** of software components. As the old proverb says: “a picture is worth a thousand words”. By using visual representations, we are able to better understand possible flaws or errors in software or business processes.
