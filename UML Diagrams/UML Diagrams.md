# UML Diagrams
A UML diagram is a diagram based on the UML (Unified Modeling Language) with the purpose of visually representing a system along with its main actors, roles, actions, artifacts or classes, in order to better understand, alter, maintain, or document information about the system.

## What is UML?
UML is an acronym that stands for **Unified Modeling Language**. Simply put, UML is a modern approach to modeling and documenting software. 
In fact, it’s one of the most popular _business process modeling techniques_.

It is based on **diagrammatic representations** of software components. As the old proverb says: “a picture is worth a thousand words”. By using visual representations, we are able to better understand possible flaws or errors in software or business processes.

UML was created as a result of the chaos revolving around software development and documentation. In the 1990s, there were several different ways to represent and document software systems. The need arose for a more unified way to visually represent those systems and as a result, in 1994-1996, the UML was developed by three software engineers working at Rational Software. It was later adopted as the standard in 1997 and has remained the standard ever since, receiving only a few updates.

## What is the use of UML?

Mainly, UML has been used as a general-purpose modeling language in the field of software engineering. However, it has now found its way into the documentation of several _business processes_ or _workflows_. For example, activity diagrams, a type of UML diagram, can be used as a replacement for flowcharts. They provide both a more standardized way of modeling workflows as well as a wider range of features to improve readability and efficacy.
