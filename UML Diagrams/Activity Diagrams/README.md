# Activity Diagrams
**_Activity Diagram_** is another important behavioral diagram in UML diagram to describe dynamic aspects of the system.
**_Activity Diagram_** is essentially an advanced version of flow chart that modeling the flow from one _activity_ to another activity.

## What is Activity Diagram?

The **_Unified Modeling Language_** includes several subsets of diagrams, including structure diagrams, interaction diagrams, and behavior diagrams. 
**_Activity Diagrams_**, along with use case and state machine diagrams, are considered behavior diagrams because they describe what must happen in the system being modeled.

Stakeholders have many issues to manage, so it's important to communicate with clarity and brevity. 
**_Activity Diagrams_** help people on the business and development sides of an organization come together to understand the same process and behavior.

## Benefits of Activity Diagrams

**_Activity Diagrams_** present a number of benefits to users. Consider creating an **_Activity Diagram_** to:

- Demonstrate the logic of an algorithm.

- Describe the steps performed in a UML use case.

- Illustrate a business process or workflow between users and the system.

- Simplify and improve any process by clarifying complicated use cases.

- Model software architecture elements, such as method, function, and operation.

## Basic components of an activity diagram

Some of the most common components of an **_Activity Diagram_** include:

- **Action:** A step in the activity wherein the users or software perform a given task.

- **Decision node:** A conditional branch in the flow that is represented by a diamond. It includes a single input and two or more outputs.

- **Control flows:** Another name for the connectors that show the flow between steps in the diagram.

- **Start node:** Symbolizes the beginning of the activity. The start node is represented by a black circle.

- **End node:** Represents the final step in the activity. The end node is represented by an outlined black circle.
