## Collaboration Diagrams 
**_Collaboration Diagrams_** are used to show how objects interact to perform the behavior of a particular use case, or a part of a use case. Along with sequence diagrams, **_collaboration_** are used by designers to define and clarify the roles of the objects that perform a particular flow of events of a use case.  They are the primary source of information used to determining class responsibilities and interfaces.
