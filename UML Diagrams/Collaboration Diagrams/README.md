# Collaboration Diagrams 
**_Collaboration Diagrams_** are used to show how objects interact to perform the behavior of a particular use case, or a part of a use case. Along with sequence diagrams, collaboration are used by designers to define and clarify the roles of the objects that perform a particular flow of events of a use case.  They are the primary source of information used to determining class responsibilities and interfaces.

## What is a Collaboration Diagram?
- A Collaboration is a collection of named objects and actors with links connecting them. They collaborate in performing some task.
- A Collaboration defines a set of participants and relationships that are meaningful for a given set of purposes.
- A Collaboration between objects working together provides emergent desirable functionalities in Object-Oriented systems.
- Each object (responsibility) partially supports emergent functionalities.
- Objects are able to produce (usable) high-level functionalities by working together.
- Objects collaborate by communicating (passing messages) with one another in order to work together.
