## Component Diagrams
**_Component Diagrams_** are integral to building your software system. Drawn out with UML diagramming software, they _help your team understand the structure of existing systems and then build new one_.

The purpose of a component diagram is to show the relationship between different components in a system. 
There exists a whole development approach that revolves around components: component-based development (CBD). In this approach, **_Component Diagrams_** allow the planner to identify the different components so the whole system does _what it's supposed to do_.

In an Object Oriented Programming approach, the **_Component Diagram_** allows a senior developer to group classes together based on common purpose so that the developer and others can look at a software development project at a high level.
