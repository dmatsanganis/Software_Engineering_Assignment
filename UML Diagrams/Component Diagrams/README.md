## Component Diagrams
**_Component Diagrams_** are integral to building your software system. Drawn out with UML diagramming software, they _help your team understand the structure of existing systems and then build new one_.

## What is a UML Component Diagram?
The purpose of a component diagram is to show the relationship between different components in a system. For the purpose of UML 2.0, the term "component" refers to a module of classes that represent independent systems or subsystems with the ability to interface with the rest of the system.

There exists a whole development approach that revolves around components: component-based development (CBD). In this approach, **_Component Diagrams_** allow the planner to identify the different components so the whole system does _what it's supposed to do_.

In an Object Oriented Programming approach, the **_Component Diagram_** allows a senior developer to group classes together based on common purpose so that the developer and others can look at a software development project at a high level.

## Benefits of Component Diagrams
Though **_Component Diagrams_** may seem complex at first glance, they are invaluable when it comes to building your system. 

**_Component Diagrams_** can help your team:

- Imagine the system’s physical structure.
- Pay attention to the system’s components and how they relate.
- Emphasize the service behavior as it relates to the interface.

## How to use Component Diagrams
A **_Component Diagram_** in UML gives a _bird’s-eye view of your software system_. Understanding the exact service behavior that each piece of your software provides will make you a better developer. 
**_Component Diagrams_** can describe software systems that are implemented in any programming language or style.

UML is a set of conventions for object-oriented diagrams that has a wide variety of applications.
In **_Component Diagrams_**, the Unified Modeling Language dictates that components and packages are wired together with lines representing assembly connectors and delegation connectors.

## How to make a Component Diagram
In Lucidchart, you can easily craft an intricate component diagram in UML from scratch. Just follow the steps below:

Open a blank document or start with a template.

Enable the UML shape library. Click "Shapes" on the left side of the editor, check "UML" in the Shape Library Manager, and click "Save."

Select the shape you want from the library you added, and drag the shape from the toolbox to the canvas.

Model the process flow by drawing lines between shapes.
