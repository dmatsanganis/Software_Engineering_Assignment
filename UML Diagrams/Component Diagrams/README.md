## Component Diagrams
**_Component Diagrams_** are integral to building your software system. Drawn out with UML diagramming software, they _help your team understand the structure of existing systems and then build new one_.

## What is a UML component diagram?
The purpose of a component diagram is to show the relationship between different components in a system. For the purpose of UML 2.0, the term "component" refers to a module of classes that represent independent systems or subsystems with the ability to interface with the rest of the system.

There exists a whole development approach that revolves around components: component-based development (CBD). In this approach, **_Component Diagrams_** allow the planner to identify the different components so the whole system does _what it's supposed to do_.

In an Object Oriented Programming approach, the **_Component Diagram_** allows a senior developer to group classes together based on common purpose so that the developer and others can look at a software development project at a high level.

## Benefits of component diagrams
Though **_Component Diagrams_** may seem complex at first glance, they are invaluable when it comes to building your system. **_Component Diagrams_** can help your team:

Imagine the system’s physical structure.

Pay attention to the system’s components and how they relate.

Emphasize the service behavior as it relates to the interface.
